Under the constitutional benchmark established by the nine-judge Constitution Bench in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India, any state intrusion into individual privacy must satisfy the fourfold test of legality, legitimate aim, proportionality, and procedural safeguards. This research paper evaluates how contemporary AI surveillance mechanisms interact with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, scrutinizing the absence of algorithmic audit standards and statutory transparency mandates.",
